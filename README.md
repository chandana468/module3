# module3
This project is a solution to the Module 3 Assignment of the Coursera HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers course by Johns Hopkins University. The goal is to create a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap 3 framework.

The page displays a navigation bar that adjusts for mobile devices, a centered heading, and a content section that simulates a menu layout for a fictional company called Food, LLC.

ðŸ“š Theory / Concepts Covered
âœ… HTML Structure
The basic structure of a webpage is created using semantic HTML elements like <nav>, <div>, and <p>.

The index.html file serves as the entry point of the website.

âœ… Responsive Design
Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and responsive classes (col-xs-12, visible-xs) are used to ensure the site works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

A hamburger menu is implemented for small screens to show navigation links in a dropdown format.

âœ… Bootstrap Framework
Bootstrap 3.3.7 is used to quickly style and structure the page with minimal custom CSS.

It includes pre-defined styles and JavaScript components like the collapsible navbar for mobile devices.

âœ… Custom CSS
A separate style.css file is used for project-specific styles such as background color, text styling, and layout adjustments.

âœ… Web Development Best Practices
Organized folder structure: index.html and all custom styles inside a css/ directory.

External linking of CSS and Bootstrap for clean and maintainable code.
